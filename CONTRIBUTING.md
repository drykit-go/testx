### Code generation

We use code generation to reduce code repetition, and consequently
reduce the complexity of implementations and the risks of errors.

We have 2 use cases for that:
- Generate repetitive declarations for each checker type declared in `internal/gen/types.go`.
- Generate public interfaces of checker providers from their implementation.

#### Generated files

The following files are generated:

<details>
  <summary>Generated files</summary>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>File</th>
        <th>Use case</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>check/check.go</code></td>
        <td>Checkers types declarations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>check/checkers.go</code></td>
        <td>Checkers types declarations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>check/providers.go</code></td>
        <td>Checkers providers interfaces</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>checkconv/assert.go</code></td>
        <td>Checkers types declarations</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</details>

These files should **never** be manually edited, as specified
in their header (your IDE will likely inform you it shouldn't be edited
if you attempt to).

#### Command

All generated files are made using a single command:

```sh
make gen
```

This builds `cmd/gen/main.go` and outputs the binary to `bin/gen`
(with your default `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables),
then runs all `//go:generate` directives found in the whole repository.
Located in `gen.go` files, these directives execute `bin/gen` binary
with various arguments.

Run this command each time:

- you declare a new checker type (in file `internal/gen/types.go`)
- you implement a new `check.<Type>CheckerProvider` or update one
in a way that changes its public interface, which includes:
  - Adding/removing a method
  - Changing a method signature (a parameter name change counts)
  - Editing a doc comment for a method

### Implementing a new checker provider

To illustrate the process described above, let's implement
`check.Complex128`, a `check.Complex128CheckerProvider`
that performs checks on type `complex128`:

1. In file `internal/gen/types.go`, add a new entry to `types`:
    ```go
    {N: "Complex128", T: "complex128"},
    ```
    Note: `N` is the **Name** of the checker provider, while **T** refers
    to the **Type** of the value it checks. Technically, the former could be
    any valid name, whereas the second must be a valid Go type.

1. Run `make gen`  
This generates `check.Complex128Checker` interface along with other
necessary declarations to work with this new type.

1. Create file `check/providers_complex128.go` and implement
`complex128CheckerProvider` following the existing models.

1. Run `make gen`  
This generates `Complex128CheckerProvider` interface that declares all public
methods implemented

1. Now the methods are accessible from outside, it's time to write unit tests :)

## Contribution suggestions

Here are some contributing suggestions:

- Implement new checkers providers, such as `check.URL`
- Add new methods (checkers) to existing checker providers, such as `check.HTTPRequest.URL`
- Improve test coverage, especially regarding checker providers' `Explain` output

## Dev environment

For an optimal dev experience, we recommend:

- Go 1.16 or higher ([download](https://golang.org/dl/))
- `make` commands available (native on Unix-based systems)
- `golangci-lint` to run linters locally ([installation](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation))

## Conventions

### Code style

Code style conventions are enforced by `golangci-lint`.
Run `make lint` to ensure your code is compliant.

### Unit tests

We try to maintain a high level of test coverage, so we encourage you
to write relevant test as much as possible when implementing a feature.

Some simple rules apply:
- Location: same directory as the tested file
- Package name: the current package suffixed with `_test`
- File name: the name of the tested file suffixed with `_test`
- Function name: the name of the tested function prefixed with `Test`

To summarize:
```go
// file: mypackage/myfile.go

package mypackage

func MyFunc() {}

// file: mypackage/myfile_test.go

package mypackage_test

func TestMyFunc(t *testing.T) {}
```
